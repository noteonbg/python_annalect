1. our logic class is ready, db part is ready..sqlachemy..
this has nothing to do with fast api.

2. we should have clarity in terms of which function
of logic.py are we writing fast api for..
input arguments and return type is getting fixed for the fastapi
function by logic.py..

logic.py returning x.
fastapi. we cannot return y. we will return x+ http status codes..

1. number based returns from fastapi
2. object based returns from fastapi function ... 
addproduct
updateproduct
listproducts
applydiscount


when your product update for add function returns false.
in web services function..
then compare it throw an exception.. 404. 

in your fastapi code...

2,3 ==6 


if a==0 or b==0
   raise HTTPException(
        status_code=status.HTTP_406_
        detail="Internal server error. Something went wrong."
    )	


problems1 webservices .py
@app.post("/bad-request", status_code=status.HTTP_2)
default status code 201
addproduct


default status code .?
updateproduct

if you get false from the logic.. throw HttpException 404, product not found




status code 200
viewallproduct

status code 200
applydiscount

keep your bp level normal go systematically get chocolate ready before
you think ..

this program should work logic.py db.py and empweb.py
Employee  - empno, empname, location, deptid.

we need to get employee if given a employee id. 
we need to update an employee deptid, location , ..
we need to see all employees
we need to see all employees based on location.

you must write one py to prove that your logic.py was working

once you are back continue the program if done let me know...
