Today story..
1. light weight ..logging.
2. more important SqlAlchemy
3. library called requests..


we did database by issuing sql commands
and using some library functions we did
insert
update
single select
multi select.
with the table of the database.
this is one approach of talking with database.

ORM approach.. -- superset..--another way to interact
with the database... usually considered simpler when
compared to whtever approach we tool earlier.. but
you should trust... rather you should practice and check..

expand ORM = 
Object  == class 
Relational   == table
Mapping   == you write a class in language X
and map to the table called Y in the database..
then you use some library that library
will help you in dealing with Y while you are
dealing objects written in X.

what is sqlalachemy
sqlalchemy is  product which will help in doing
ORM .
what is ORM.
dealing with the database via classes..
dealing with relation's by using objects.... 
it helps in mapping tables to classes..
this is 

Abstraction.
Sqlalchemy gives better abstraction when compared to using
raw sql while dealing with database..

python gives us better abstraction when compared to C++ or java
hopefully...

SqLLite by default
if we get connected with a thread t1.. it will allow connnections
only in the thread t1

if some other thread called t2 comes tries to access it
does not allow. we want to stop this behavior of sql llite
hence we told 

any technology provider wants people to use the technology
so he will provide two things.

1. user guide  == people who learning should prefer this
2. documentation  == to know about a function or a class.

all frameworks are other people opinions..

design patterns..
generalizing commonly used scenarios..

factory is a design pattern..
object pool  -- if something is expensive to create at runtime
you precreate it and keep it and give as when need is required..
object pool





focus on implementing 
by using sqlalachemy..
no web service
logic.py
db.py
employee.py






	today we sqlalchemy
	class to a table..

	logging.  -- to used as part of coding to leave traces
	what happened to our program.

	as we keep coding we should keep doing logging.
	requests library

	I am coding, I am logging also...
	I have trouble now, then I will log, pathetic..
	Logging and debugging.

	fasapi functions.. you called from postman..
	requests library...
	
	practice sqlachemy... how are you mapping classes and tables..

	database.
	sql way
	orm way..( you should pick this() --lines will of code will
	reduce
	
	Thanks a lot
