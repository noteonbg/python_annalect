Logging Levels:

DEBUG: Detailed, diagnostic information, generally only useful for developers.
INFO: Regular operational information, such as the flow of the application.
WARNING: Indicates a potential problem or something unusual that might require attention.
ERROR: A more serious issue that has affected the programâ€™s functionality.
CRITICAL: A very serious error that likely causes the program to terminate.
Log Handlers:

StreamHandler: Sends logs to the console.
FileHandler: Sends logs to a file, which is great for persistent log storage.
Custom Loggers: You can create separate loggers for different parts of your application to control logging behavior more precisely.
